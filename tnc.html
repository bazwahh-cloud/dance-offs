      <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
      <p>Last updated: 21 February 2026</p>

      <p>Welcome to Dance-Offs. By using this website, you agree to the following Terms & Conditions. If you do not agree, please stop using the site immediately.</p>

      <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
      <p>You must be at least 18 years old to use Dance-Offs. Users must ensure that entering competitions and prize draws is legal in their country of residence.</p>

      <h2>2. User-Generated Content</h2>
      <p>User-generated content includes videos, DJ mixes, images, profiles, and any material you upload. By submitting content, you confirm that you own the rights and that your content does not violate copyright or contain harmful material.</p>

      <h2>3. YouTube Video Requirements (Dancers)</h2>
      <p>Your YouTube video must be Public or Unlisted, embeddable, not age-restricted, and not blocked in the UK. Private or restricted videos cannot be accepted.</p>

      <h2>4. DJ Mix Requirements</h2>
      <p>DJ mixes must be MP3 format. You confirm you have permission to use all music included. Copyrighted or harmful content may be removed.</p>

      <!-- UPDATED VOTING SYSTEM -->
      <h2>5. Voting System</h2>
      <p>All votes on Dance-Offs are paid votes. Each paid vote counts as one entry into the monthly Prize Draw and contributes to the dancer’s leaderboard position.</p>

      <p>When you cast a vote, you are purchasing an entry into the Prize Draw for that month. The more votes you cast, the more entries you receive.</p>

      <p>All votes are final once submitted. Votes cannot be cancelled, refunded, or transferred.</p>

      <p>Users must ensure their email address is correct when voting. Dance-Offs is not responsible for missed notifications due to incorrect contact details.</p>

      <p>Any attempt to manipulate or unfairly influence the voting system — including automated voting, duplicate accounts, fraudulent payments, or abusive behaviour — may result in removal of votes, disqualification from the Prize Draw, or suspension from the platform.</p>

      <p>Dance-Offs may pause, amend, or withdraw the voting system if technical issues or misuse occur. Dance-Offs may end a voting period early if required, but will always give clear notice on the website.</p>

      <!-- UPDATED PRIZE DRAW -->
      <h2>6. Prize Draw</h2>
      <p>Every paid vote submitted during the calendar month counts as one entry into that month’s Prize Draw.</p>

      <p>The Prize Draw is conducted using a randomised, automated selection system to ensure fairness.</p>

      <p>Winners will be contacted using the email address provided during voting. If the winner does not respond within 7 days, Dance-Offs may select an alternative winner.</p>

      <p>Prizes may include event tickets, experiences, cash alternatives, merchandise, or other promotional rewards. The monthly prize is displayed on the Prizes page.</p>

      <p>If the winner cannot attend an event-based prize, they may nominate another person to attend or request a cash alternative (if available).</p>

      <p>Dance-Offs may request proof of identity or eligibility before issuing a prize.</p>

      <p>Dance-Offs is not responsible for travel costs, accommodation, additional expenses, or losses caused by third-party providers.</p>

      <p>Dance-Offs may cancel or amend a Prize Draw if circumstances beyond our control require it.</p>

      <h2>7. Payments</h2>
      <p>Payments are processed securely by third-party providers. Dance-Offs does not store card details. All purchases are final unless required by law.</p>

      <!-- UPDATED GDPR SECTION -->
      <h2>8. GDPR & Data Protection</h2>
      <p>Under UK GDPR, you have the right to access, correct, or delete your data. You may also opt out of data processing.</p>
